# Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of sales performance across different dimensions such as time, product categories, customer segments, and regions. It is designed to help businesses understand key trends, identify top-performing products, and optimize sales strategies for better results.

The project leverages SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive data visualization. The final Power BI dashboard offers insights into sales metrics, seasonal trends, and customer purchasing behavior.

## Project Structure
- **Data Sources**: Raw sales data (historical sales records, customer data, product data).
- **Data Preparation**: SQL scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard to visualize sales KPIs and trends.

## Key Features
1. **Sales Overview**: Summary of key sales metrics, including total revenue, total units sold, and average order value.
2. **Product Analysis**: Insights into top-selling products, sales by product category, and revenue contribution.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Breakdown of sales by customer demographics, including customer location and loyalty status.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Trends in sales over time (monthly and yearly views).
5. **Regional Performance**: Analysis of sales by geographic regions to identify high-performing areas.

## Data Preparation
### 1. Data Cleaning
   - **SQL** was used to clean the raw sales data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.
   - The cleaned data is then exported to CSV files and then integrated into Power BI.

### 2. Data Transformation
   - SQL queries are used to aggregate sales metrics and create new calculated fields such as revenue per customer, average order value, etc.
   - The transformed data is structured for optimal use in the Power BI dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **Power BI**: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.
